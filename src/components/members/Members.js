Her roles from that time include the enthusiastic "Mardi Gras reveler" in a first season episode of the unquestionably prestigious Matthew McConaughey, Woody Harrelson cop drama <I>True Detective</I>, the hype AF "Mardi Gras reveler" in the seminal Jesse Eisenberg vehicle <I>Now You See Me</I>, and the patient and perceptive "Liquor store worker" in the Will Ferrell, Zach Galifianakis blockbuster critical darling <I>The Campaign</I>.
